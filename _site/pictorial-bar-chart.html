				<h1>Pictorial Bar Chart</h1>
				<p><a id="pictorial-bar-description"></a></p>

<p>The Pictorial Bar Chart is similar in layout to a conventional 100% stacked <a href="/documentation/column-bar-chart">bar chart</a> but uses a row of symbols, with different symbols for each series.</p>

<h3 id="interactions">Interactions</h3>

<p>On hover a tooltip shows a series’ details on hover.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>The first column is the label for each bar. All subsequent columns are data series.</p>

<p><span class="tip">By default, colours and glyphs are chosen automatically, however in all cases the glyphs - at least - should be overridden by configuration (see <a href="#customizing-glyphs">below</a>).</span></p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<h2 id="options">Options</h2>

<p>The following data attributes are available for a Pictorial Bar Chart.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>data-fm-height</dt><dd>Enforces an explicit height. Expects a value with CCS syntax, e.g. "250px" (see <a href="/documentation/chart-layout-and-sizing/#size">sizing guide</a>)</dd>
 <dt>data-fm-width</dt><dd>Enforces an explicit width. Expects a value with CCS syntax, e.g. "800px" (see <a href="/documentation/chart-layout-and-sizing/#size">sizing guide</a>)</dd>
 <dt>data-fm-enable-spillover</dt><dd>If "true", the pictorial bar chart will draw some transient elements outside of its configured height and width (see <a href="/documentation/chart-layout-and-sizing/#spillover">layout guide</a>)</dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="customizing-glyphs">Customizing glyphs</h2>

<h3 id="using-custom-glyphs">Using custom glyphs</h3>

<p>By default, the Pictorial Bar Chart will use the first letter of the series title (columns header) as the symbol to represent the series - for example, “Male executives” would be represented by an “m”. In most cases this is not suitable and should be avoided. You can choose a different glyph for the series by adding the “data-fm-glyph” attribute to the <code>th</code>, like so:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers" data-src="/code-examples/pictorial-bar-glyph-example.html"></pre>

<p>Any character can be used. In the example above, the charcter is a standard UTF-8 character, which can be used as an HTML entity code or (if the HTML document has the correct character set) the character itself.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-glyph-classes">Customizing glyph classes</h3>

<p>As well as changing the glyph, you can apply a CSS class using the “data-fm-glyph-class” annotation on a <code>th</code>. For example, ‘data-fm-glyph-class=”male”’ would apply a class of “male” to all symbols for Males:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers" data-src="/code-examples/pictorial-bar-glyph-class-example.html"></pre>

<p><span class="tip">Remember that the glyphs are rendered as SVG text elements, so the CSS rules are different from those for HTML. For example, SVG supports “stroke” and “fill”.</span></p>

<h3 id="using-icon-fonts">Using icon fonts</h3>

<p>By providing a custom glyph class, setting the “font-family”, and using HTML character entities as glyphs you can utilize icon fonts. For example:</p>

<pre class="line-numbers" data-src="/code-examples/pictorial-bar-glyph-icon-font-example.html"></pre>

<p>There are a number of tools online which can help you find the HTML entity value, including <a href="http://unicode.online-toolz.com/tools/unicode-html-entities-convertor.php" alt="Online entity converter">this one from Toolz</a>.</p>
