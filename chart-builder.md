Factmint Chart Builder provides a graphical interface for users to quickly generate embed code for Factmint Charts. It also gives users a live preview of the chart that they are creating.

### Usage:
N.B. You can use the chart builder without signing in but be aware that you cannot publish a chart on a domain that you have not registered. You can sign in and register a domainÂ at <a href="http://charts.factmint.com">charts.factmint.com</a>.

Data can either be directly input to the Chart Builder, or copied and pasted from a spreadsheet.

Different charts require require a different number of columns and/or formats of data: there are headings at the top of each column to help you with this. For more information about the columns of data required for each chart, please take a look at our <a href="http://factmint.com/documentation/">full documentation</a>.

### Building your Chart:

<ol style="margin-left: 2em;">
	<li>The desired chart can be selected from the dropdown above the preview area.</li>
	<li>The column headers in the input table change according to the chosen visualization to give the user an idea about what data should be in each column.</li>
	<li>Once the user has input their data and selected their chart, they should see a live preview.</li>
	<li>Users can manipulate various options relating to the chart in the input fields to the right of the page.</li>
</ol>
