## Basic usage

Factmint Charts work by reading HTML tables with certain classes and replacing them with an interactive SVG data visualization.

### Example

<pre data-src="code-examples/basic-example.html" class="line-numbers"></pre>

*It's a good idea to add the "async" attribute to the script tag, so it doesn't interfere with page load times as much.*
